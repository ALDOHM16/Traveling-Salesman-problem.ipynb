# Traveling-Salesman-problem
Use a Jupyter Notebook to create the program in Python to solve the Traveling Salesman problem using a Genetic Algorithm. And run it!
Here are the details of this task:
The list of cities and their connections (distances and costs) are represented by the undirected graph shown below.
You need to find a representation of this graph in order to be able to find viable solutions, with the lowest cost possible and within 72 hours.
